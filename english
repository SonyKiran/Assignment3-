You're welcome to
any book in my
library.

I wish I were rich.
Are you going or
not?                      ?
We're not accusing
you of anything.
I couldn't eat fish
when I was a child.
Tom wants to say
hello.
Are you saying this
doesn't matter?                   ?
I've heard that you
shouldn't eat red
meat more than
once a day.
I don't know why I
even bother
anymore.
She was in the
hospital for six
weeks because she
was sick.
You and I should
stick together.
About how much will
it cost?                      ?
Tom let me stay
with Mary.
I know I deserve
this.
Let's talk about your
work.

Tom cut his sister a
piece of cake.
Is everyone against
him?                                          ?
I'll be in the
basement.
I want Tom to read
this.
Don't make eye
contact.
Could you tell me
where Tom is?                         ?
You're my boss.
Never hesitate to tell
the truth.
Tom has got
nowhere to go.
Tom is their leader.
The lighting blinded
me for a while.
Could you show me
this bag?                     ?
Tom and I are
planning on getting      20
married on October
20th.
I've been to the
supermarket.

He is now almost as
tall as his father is.
I was unable to
control myself any
longer.

Try doing that again.
This dish is too
spicy.

Tom told me I
shouldn't talk to you.
How many people
are on board the
ship?                                             ?
Was that Tom you
were just talking to?                     ?
Don't tell my wife
that.
Tom looked out the
window and saw
Mary.
Tom is most likely
eating now.
Can you translate
this manuscript from
French to English?                            ?
The only spice Tom
puts on meat is
pepper.

Tom says his left leg
hurts.
I heard that he left
town and moved
east.
We were kids
together.
Isn't that the Golden
Gate Bridge?              ?
There's almost no
milk left in the glass.
Tom called me this
afternoon.
Tom read Mary a
bedtime story.

There's the bell.

Are you good at
remembering faces?            ?
Tom and Mary
wanted to be
together.
Tom's wicked.

You must try and
come to the party.
You saw them,                                         ,
didn't you?               ?
The doctor took his
pulse.

We're thinking about
putting our house up
for sale.
Would you please
pour me a cup of
coffee?                                   ?
We kept together for
safety.
Tom is eating a
cake.
Odd, isn't it? We
should have already
arrived.                  ,       ?
Mary's not pretty,
but she isn't ugly,                               ,
either.
I'm sorry, you have                   ,
the wrong number.
He is a man of his
word.

He always took a
seat in the front row.
The pond has frozen
over.
I know the boy.
He was not about to
admit his mistake.
I don't think I can do
everything by
myself.
I suppose you'll be
studying all day
tomorrow.
Mary is Tom's
daughter-in-law.
I'll go if you will.

Tom tried to hide his
confusion.

You're turning red.
I will accept the
work, provided that
you help me.
Tom didn't seem
happy to see me.
My watch loses
three minutes a
week.
Why can't Tom
leave?                          ?
The poor girl went
blind.
I found out
something
interesting today.
Tom loaded the
truck with sand.
They don't
understand me
when I speak
German.
Tom is the only
person who can do           ,
that, I think.

I know why Tom
agreed to do that.
Tom turned down
the radio.
She was asked not
to speak at the
meeting.
I'm not sure if I'm
going to be able to
be there on time.
The damage was
covered by
insurance.
There was a bridge
across each river.
I've got a little
problem.
Tom can't afford to
buy a yacht.
The policeman put
handcuffs on Tom.

I value my privacy.
Stop protecting me.
Please accept my
apology.

I've already spoken
to Tom about that.
I wonder if Tom
would really do
something like that.
Tom taught me to
play chess.
I just got here this
morning.
Tom is between
jobs.
Tom certainly knew
about the problem.
                        ,
OK, I think we can
begin.
My grandfather has
gray hair.
Could you give me a
lift home?                       ?

The librarian looked
quite sick.
How much money
do you think Tom
makes?                                    ?
Tom wants to end
this.
Tom is still learning
the rules.
How could I've let
that happen?                 ?
It's there now.
Not a sound was
heard.
Tom knew I was
jealous.

I don't care what
people think.
I've read
somewhere that it's
not true.
He put salt into his
cup of coffee by
mistake.
I'll arrive on October               20
20th.
What's the worst
thing that could
happen?                  ?

Tom seems bored.
Can I offer a
suggestion?                                       ?
Do you have a
piano?                                        ?

I ran to school.
You're standing on
my foot.
Let's leave as soon
as he gets back.

Where's it used?                          ?
You've probably
forgotten about it
already.
You shouldn't let
him get away with
cheating.
We have to get out
of here fast.

Tom can't answer.
The cat is in the
box.
You were treated
unfairly.
It's obsolete.

What's the fastest
way to get to the
airport?                 ?
Tom didn't know
Mary wanted him to
help her.
I don't have a lot of
patients.
Tom will need your
help.
I think I speak
French about as
well as Tom does.
In New York, the
dollar was worth
eight shillings.

Look what I found
on my way home.
We will now report
on this year's
business results.
This will take some
time.
It took me several
hours to paint that
room.
We know what to
expect.
Did you really dream
about me?                    ?
You probably just
have a cold.
Tom says he was
fired.
Please stay inside.
Can you please tell
me where the
restaurant is?                           ?
Don't you feel cold?                     ?
Can she come in
time?
                                     ?
You can't know that.

I'll dream about you.
The customer is not
always right.
I have things on my
mind.
All of the men were
dressed similarly to
Tom.

I've burnt the toast.
That was an
experience.

I hate myself.
I told Tom you'd
wait.

Tom started packing
his suitcase.
I've been expecting
your call.
I wish she had come
last night.

I had a good time.

It soon began to rain
very hard.
I don't care what will
become of me.
Please lock the
door.
I know that Tom was
first.
I think I need
braces.
Have you ever
climbed Mt. Fuji?        ?

I'll call back soon.
What makes you
think that I'm against
that?                            ?
We have a complete
set of the recordings
of Beethoven's
symphonies.
She's thirty-three.

Tom said he'll wait.

He lost his temper
and shouted at me.
Does Tom really
have a girlfriend?                  ?
There are some
differences.

It's pretty amazing.
To lose face means
to be humiliated.
Everybody knows
that he is honest.
I want to make
some changes.
It's going to be a
long trip.
It just won't work.
Enjoy yourself.
I'm not going to
sing.
I didn't know Tom
was at home.

Tom and Mary said
they'd be a bit late.
Is that enough?                 ?
Choose one.

Tom doesn't know
how sick Mary is.
Their house is near
here.
Tom didn't want to
admit he was
scared.
The door must not
be left open.
The Normans
conquered England       1066
in 1066.
He dug a hole in the
garden.
Tom is going to be
jealous.
She left the room
without saying a
word.
Tom is our foster
son.
Let us tell you why
we came.
Mary doesn't want
to end up being an
old maid.
You can hear
English on Channel      1
1, and Japanese on          7
Channel 7.

Owls hunt at night.
They arrived at the
hotel.
I had lunch with
Tom today.
I was really
depressed.
I slept only two
hours.
Everybody jumped
into the pool.

I told Tom to go to
the police.
I can't stand raw
fish.
Tom had absolutely
no idea what to do.
The waiter came
over to take away
Tom's empty plate.

I don't think that
we'll ever know what
happened to Tom.
I cannot possibly
help you.
I didn't swim
because it was too
cold.

My father says he's
planning to buy me
a horse.
Tom is seldom
home.
I respect you for
what you have
done.
Tom loved the song
even though the
lyrics were in a
language he didn't
understand.

The teacher wrote
French words on the
blackboard.
Here's where they
usually have dinner.

Tom told us he
loved skiing.
I've learned so
much from you.
The time will come
when she'll regret it.

Tom's unstoppable.
Tom has been
managing just fine.

I have cut my finger.
I'll tell you
everything that you
want to know.
Are you sleepy?          ?
I sat down next to
him.
You did your job
well.
If you want quality,         ,
pay for it.
Tom was the only
one not sitting.
Tom refused to
answer our
questions.
I have nothing to do
this afternoon.
We think you're
right.
You shouldn't trust
anything Tom says.
There are three
printing presses in
the workshop.
Is it true that Tom
can't see very well
out of his left eye?              ?
I don't think that
Tom knows the
rules yet.
I like your
apartment.
Would you like a
glass of water?                                               ?
The computer is
broken.
Tom doesn't like
competition.

Why pay when you
can get it for free?                                      ?

Tom asked Mary to
wait for him here.
What does this
machine do exactly?                   ?

I admit, I'm not the                                  ,
tidiest person in the
world.

Where do I sign up?           ?
I really liked the
movie.
Tom is the only
person Mary says
she can trust.
Tell Tom that I'll
prune his trees for
him.


I'd like to ask you for
some advice.
Can you imagine
what life would be
like without
television?             Can               ?
There was a tall tree
in front of my house.
Should I quit my
job?                                              ?

I wish I had Tom's
brains.
Didn't you know that
Tom and I needed
to do that?                                   ?
We've been looking
for you everywhere.

I want you to put out
that cigarette.
Tom asked Mary
what was wrong.
I used to cry a lot.
There isn't
anywhere else to
park.
He is no ordinary
man.
He can touch his
nose with his
tongue.
                                                              ,
If he's still alive, he'd
be very old by now.
Tom wanted me to
help him.
Does Tom speak
French better than
Mary?                                         ?
They'll kill me.
Tom is stuck.
How does he do
this?                       ?
Tom put his shirt on
a hanger.
I love making
desserts.

That sounded weird.
It could be a
weapon.

I think you know
what I'm talking
about.
Where is your
brother?                                ?
What were we
thinking?                               ?
A nod is as good as
a wink to a blind
horse.
Tom was home on
Monday.

She wanted him to
say that he loved
her.
Could you excuse
us a sec?                       ?
He goes fishing
every other day.
Tom doesn't want to
leave.

I'll miss everyone.
The customer
agrees.

I am working on my
new book.

It caught my eye.
I won't let anybody
hurt you.

Tom gave a famous
singer ten thousand
dollars to come to
the restaurant to
sing Happy Birthday.
We're at home
today.
This isn't for sale.
Tom heard
everything they said.
Tom's career is
over.
Tom is sleeping in
the living room.
It started as a
hobby.
Where were you
yesterday?              ?
We have don't get
many opportunities
to speak French.
Check it again.
You were my
inspiration.
I need to know who
Tom is.
These aren't yours,
are they?                           ?
The tea is very
tasty.
The burglar came
into the house
through this door.
Tom likes watching
action movies.
She's the French
ambassador to
Portugal.

Tom did what he
promised he'd do.

I don't want to break
your heart.

I want to be ready
for anything.
Tom and I aren't
afraid.

Tom and I both live
and work in
Australia.
The water was ice
cold.
Do you do anything
else?                              ?
Source
Tom pointed to his
chest.
They were silent.
I didn't know you'd
be jealous.
We stayed behind to
help Tom.
Don't meddle in my
affairs.
They're all equal.
Tom continued
digging.
It's doubtful that
anything will grow
here.
I know that this is
important to you.
My house is on the
outskirts of town.
It's time to get up.
Mary is a brave
woman.
Why didn't you tell
us there was a
witness?                                       ?
Is that your idea?                     ?
Why are you
yawning?                                   ?
School begins in
April.
Is it OK if I eat one
of these apples?               ?
Look straight ahead.
That result was
predictable.            able
I didn't know you
were going to be
there.
I'll phone you as
soon as I get to the
airport.

That's a stupid rule.
I can't let you do
this.

We started to walk.
It's an illusion.
I have a few
minutes.
Tom is still an                     te
amateur.
The plank froze to
the ground.

He is capable of
teaching French.
This street used to
have another name.

I'm wasting my time.
Let's forget it.
Where can I
exchange foreign
currency?                       ?
I thought I heard
you.
Tom's paralyzed.
Do you know this
part of the city very
well?                           ?
I closed the door.

The girl I wanted to
marry married
somebody else.
Tom switched off
the dryer.
Do you remember
what time Tom said
he'd be here?               ?
Tom has always
wanted to study
French.

She wrapped her
arms around his
neck.

I want you to take
me to Tom.
Tom couldn't wait
until the weekend.
Tom will unlikely win
today.

Let's do what Tom
wants us to do.
If Tom is happy, I'm                     ,
happy.
Tom knew that Mary
was awake.
Almost no one
thinks that we are
sisters.
Tom married a girl
much younger than
himself.
I recognized him
immediately.
I don't remember
mailing the letter.
Tom locked his
doors.
I want another beer.
What do I have to
say to convince
you?                    ?

I know how it feels.
There is probably an
easy solution to the
problem.
The milk tastes
sour.
The result will
satisfy him.
You recovered
quickly.
What should I tell
Tom?                            ?
Tom thought that
Mary was John's
sister.

She is from                     ,
Hokkaido, but is
now living in Tokyo.
You're not like
everyone else.
I thought that Tom
was guilty.
Why didn't Tom tell
us?                                 ?
Why didn't you say
goodbye?                            ?
Please show me
how to do that.
Tom plays the piano
very well.
My aunt had three
kids.
Tom isn't my uncle.
Tom was the one
who got punished.
                                        ,
I'm sorry, but could
you move over a bit
so I have room to
sit?                                ?
School was
cancelled because
of the snow.
Tom isn't used to
city life.
Tom didn't say how
he planned to get
there.

If Tom wasn't so
stupid, he would've         ,
understood quicker.
She is learning how
to drive a car.
Please don't tell
anyone I did that.
I have terrible
handwriting.
Tom has never
driven a car before.
No one's hungry.
I am a monk.

I wonder if Tom has
ever been to
Boston.
We shouldn't have
bought this car.
What is your
greatest strength?      ?
Tom is on Mary's
side.

Tom doesn't feel like
doing that now.
I don't feel like
working today.
Tom didn't notice
the change.
It's not too hard.
Evil sometimes
wins.
I'm sure it'll pass.
They might not
notice that Tom isn't
here.
Tom put the kids to
bed.
Hey, get your hands     ,
off me.
I knew you wouldn't
want to go with us.
They're green.
I didn't eat anything
else.
Why did you want to
speak to me?                    ?
I'm afraid I'll be a
burden to you.
Tom speaks French
better than Mary
does.
Tom will always
remember Mary.
I saw Tom sitting at
the bar alone,              ,
drinking wine.
Tom was obviously
scared.
Please do
something about it.
Some boys came
into the classroom.
Take over.
Do you have a
birthmark?                          ?
I behaved myself.
Tom is here with me
now.

Tom wasn't working
for me.
Tom didn't even
know who Mary
was.
I don't think I
impressed Tom.
Tom has gone
away.
You must clear the
table.

I'm glad Tom helped
us.
This doesn't happen
very often.
Tom told me that he
was at school.
I didn't receive any
notice.

I hate this game.

It's always darkest
before the dawn.
I will win the game
next time.
Tom told me that
he'd be home on
Monday.
Tom's death was
mysterious.
There's not enough
time to eat now.
She wrote the book
about people she
visited.
I like your work.

I want to date other
women.
I don't think that it
means anything.
They say that
Isabela died.
I never liked
Christmas.

I've never been to
Australia.
Tom was smart
enough to escape.


I know you hate it.
All the children like
you.
The automobile
stopped.
Why don't we have
dinner?                                         ?
A group of
foreigners arrived in
Edo, in other words             ,
Tokyo.
Tom and I have
nothing to hide.

I feel very guilty.
Tom is loyal to his
wife.
Our next meeting
will be held next on        20
October 20th.
We've all seen that
before.
Nobody complained.
I'm not strong
enough to do that.
Tom fell through the
ice.
Tom is doing an
exemplary job.
Was Tom the one
who told you to do
that?                       ?
Don't panic!                    !
Where did you get
your camera
repaired?                               ?
I have news about
Tom.
How about going
out for lunch?                      ?
You always talk
back to me, don't                           ,
you?                    ?
I used to be poor
like you.
I got a smooth
shave.
Tom pocketed the
money.
Take this chair. It's
sturdy.
How often do you
take a shower?              ?

I'd like to introduce
Tom to Mary.
She is anxious
about your health.
I want to wash my
hair.
Tom was hoping
that he could help
Mary.
Look what you've
done to me.
It's here.
I must buy a new
pair of shoes.
Thousands of
homes were
destroyed.
I see the dog.
I wasn't able to find
